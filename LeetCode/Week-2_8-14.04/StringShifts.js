/*
You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift, where shift[i] = [direction, amount]:

  - direction can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift). 
  - amount is the amount by which string s is to be shifted.
  - A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the end.
  - Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to the beginning.

  Return the final string after all operations.
